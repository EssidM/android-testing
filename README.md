# Android Testing
This project will cover samples or Android Test cases : <b>unit</b> and <b>instrumentation</b> tests.
For this we used some samples and tutorials like :

* [Official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/start/index.html)
* [myKong Email Validation Tutorial](https://www.mkyong.com/regular-expressions/how-to-validate-email-address-with-regular-expression/)

## Case 1: Android Email Validation (Unit Testing)
It's about unit testing based on JUnit 4.12
Create a class named app/src/main/.../<b>EmailValidator</b> & app/src/test/.../<b>EmailValidatorTest</b>
that will contains methods that test if Email validation is working properly.
